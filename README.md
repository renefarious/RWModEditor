The app can:
-Visualize your .ini file contents instead of showing lines of text
-Create template with built-in templates (I have something in my mind that you may like it in the future update)
-Save/Load ini file
-Add/Delete Sections/Properties
Features:
-Text Autocomplete/Suggestion (Not finished yet)
-Reorder Sections/Properties (Tap and Hold the left most icon then drag)
-Appearance (Font size not available yet, subjected to change)
-You can use your own custom fonts!

Note:
-Dynamic(Material You) theme is only available above Android 12!

-No Undo button but Dialog will save you if you accidentally click the Delete button😆
